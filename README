# Four-in-a-Row (4x4 Tic-Tac-Toe)

## Description
This is a web-based implementation of a 4x4 "Four-in-a-Row" Tic-Tac-Toe game. Two players (the user and the computer) take turns placing “O” and “X” marks on a 4x4 board. The objective is to get four of the same symbol in a row—vertically, horizontally, or diagonally.

The game features:
- Coin flip to determine who starts
- Interactive 4x4 board UI
- Game logic separated from UI
- Server-side state persistence using Node.js/Express
- JSDoc-documented source code
- Basic computer opponent with automatic move delays
